# gtld-feed
A json feed generator for checking for new IANA gTLDs

## Why?
ICANN/IANA maintains a [list](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/tlds-2012-02-25-en) of all the gTLDs, but it's kind of pain to look through. So I figured I could make a syndicated feed of all the new ones by checking against the old ones.
